# TOP odin-recipes
In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website using HTML knowledge. 
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
I will review how to use <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <strong>, <em>, <!-- -->, <ul> <ol>, <a>click me</a>, 
<a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click me</a>, <img src="" alt="">; relative and absolute links.
