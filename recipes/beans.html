    <h2 class="Yellow" id="Descript">Description</h2>
    <p>White Beans baked with mushrooms and marinara and has quite a bit of potential for customization.</p>

    <h2 class="Yellow">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul id="list">
        <li class="gray">8 oz. mushrooms</li>
        <li >2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li class="gray">1 pinch salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li class="gray">2 cups marinara (or more to your liking)</li>
        <li>2 15oz. cans butter beans</li>
        <li class="gray">1/2 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper</li>
        <li class="gray">4 oz. mozzarella</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="Yellow">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Wash and slice the mushrooms. Add the mushrooms, olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper to a deep skillet. Sauté the mushrooms until they have wilted and all the moisture in the skillet has evaporated.</li>
        <li>While the mushrooms are sautéing, mince the garlic, drain and rinse the butter beans. Add the garlic to the skillet with the mushrooms and sauté for 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add the rinsed butter beans, marinara, basil, and red pepper to the skillet. Stir everything to combine, then allow it to heat through, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>While the skillet is heating through, shred the mozzarella. Top the skillet with the mozzarella, then cover the skillet with foil. Transfer the skillet to the oven* and bake for 5-7 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Once the cheese has melted, remove the foil, switch the oven to broil, and broil the skillet for a few minutes more to brown the cheese (watch closely, as browning can happen quickly with the broiler). Serve hot, with garlic bread for dipping!</li>
