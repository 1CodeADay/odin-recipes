    <h2 class="Yellow" >Description</h2>
    <p>The concept for this southwest tofu scramble had been in the back of my head for a while, but I kept putting it off because, to be honest, it didnâ€™t sound very exciting. But then I finally tried it this weekend I was pretty blown away by how good it tasted despite being incredible fast to make. And then when I realized how many different ways you could serve it, this tofu scramble instantly became a new favorite. ðŸ™Œ.</p>

    <h2 class="Yellow" id="Descript">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul id="list">
        <li class="gray">14 oz. firm tofu</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric (optional for color)</li>
        <li class="gray">1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li class="gray">1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li class="gray">1/4 tsp freshly cracked pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li class="gray">1 10oz. can diced tomatoes with green chiles</li>
        <li>2 green onions, sliced ($0.20)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="Yellow">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Remove the tofu from the package and drain the excess liquid (no need to press the tofu). Place the tofu in a bowl and use your hands to break it into crumbles.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the turmeric, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the spice mix over the crumbled tofu and then gently stir until the tofu is evenly coated in spices.</li>
        <li>Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the cooking oil to the skillet, swirl to coat the surface, then add the tofu.</li>
        <li>Cook the tofu for about five minutes, stirring occasionally, or until heated through. The color of the turmeric will brighten as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Drain the canned tomatoes well, then add them to the skillet. Stir to combine, then cook another five minutes or until heated through.</li>
        <li>Taste the tofu and adjust the seasonings to your liking. Sprinkle the sliced green onions over top, then serve.</li>
    </ol>
